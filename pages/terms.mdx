      Nature of this Service
      <ol>
        <li>Please see the Schedule for more information and terms concerning this Service.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Licence Terms and Restrictions
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Service, including the materials made available on or through the Service, is owned by, licensed to,
          managed or controlled by GovTech. Please see clause 4 (Third Party Materials) for more information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Subject to these Terms of Use, GovTech grants to you a non-exclusive and non-transferable right to access and
          use the Service for personal or internal purposes only, and only for such use permitted by the functions of
          the Service. You shall not, amongst other things, modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, adapt, publish,
          redistribute or sublicense the Service or any part of the Service without the prior written consent of GovTech
          or the respective third party owners. You also shall not use the Service in violation of any applicable laws
          or agreements that you have with any third parties. All express or implied rights to the Service not
          specifically granted herein are expressly reserved to GovTech.
        </li>
        <li>
          GovTech reserves the right to:
          <ol>
            <li>Update or modify this Service from time to time;</li>
            <li>
              Deny or restrict access to or use of the Service by any particular person without ascribing any reasons
              whatsoever; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Discontinue this Service at any time without notice or liability to you whatsoever, whereupon all rights
              granted to you hereunder shall also terminate forthwith. You shall further upon notice from GovTech return
              or destroy all copies of the Service or materials therein that you may have downloaded.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          You will not interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Service or otherwise do anything
          that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on GovTech’s servers
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Third Party Materials
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Service may require, enable or facilitate access to or use of software or services of a third party (“
          <b>Third Party</b>”). In such an event, there may be terms of use of the third party software or service (the “Third
          Party Terms”). GovTech may be required under or as a result of the <b>Third Party Terms</b> to notify you of certain
          terms that apply to you (either directly as an end user, or as a party whose acts or omissions could cause GovTech
          to breach the Third Party Terms) when you use the Services. An example of Third Party Terms may be open source
          software terms or standard form terms of the distribution platform from which you obtain any part of the Service
          (e.g. Google Play Store or Apple App Store terms) which bind GovTech as a developer or user of the distribution
          platform (the “<b>Distribution Terms”</b>). Information on the Third Party Terms are embedded in the Service, already
          accounted for in these Terms of Use, publicly available (e.g the Distribution Terms) or otherwise listed in the
          Schedule herein. For the avoidance of doubt, insofar as this Clause 4 relates to the Distribution Terms, the relevant
          Distribution Terms are the terms of the specific platform from which you obtained a copy of the software or application
          that is part of the Service. For example, if you obtained the said copy from the Google Play Store, then the relevant
          terms are Google’s Distribution Terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is your responsibility to check and read the most up-to-date versions of these Third Party Terms and you
          are deemed to have notice of the same. In particular, you are deemed to have notice of the Third Party Terms
          that GovTech (under the Third Party Terms) is required to notify you, and you unconditionally agree to be
          bound by all the obligations in the Third Party Terms which are applicable to you as the end user.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the Third Party Terms require you to enter into an agreement directly with the Third Party, then you
          unconditionally agree to enter into such agreement, and in any event, to be legally bound by the Third Party
          Terms. For the avoidance of doubt:
          <ol>
            <li>
              some Third Party Terms (particularly open-source terms) permit either a direct licence to you from the
              Third Party or a sublicence from GovTech to you. In such cases, your licence is a direct licence from the
              Third Party to you; and
            </li>
            <li>
              the terms of your agreement with the Third Party will govern your use of the relevant third party software
              or service, and not these Terms of Use.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          If the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require GovTech to incorporate certain terms in these Terms of
          Use (inclusive of terms which impose any minimum or maximum standards herein, and/or terms described in Clause
          4.5 below), such terms are deemed to have been so incorporated (the “<b>Incorporated Terms”</b>). Examples of
          Incorporated Terms include provisions which require GovTech to give you notice of certain rights and
          liabilities or require GovTech to ensure that you acknowledge certain matters. Similarly, if the Third Party
          Terms expressly or impliedly require these Terms of Use to be altered such that the Third Party Terms are
          complied with, the parties herein agree that the Terms of Use shall be deemed to be so altered but only to the
          extent necessary for compliance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some Third Party Terms grant the Third Party, or require GovTech to grant the Third Party, direct rights of
          enforcement of these Terms of Use as a third party beneficiary, against you. Such Third Party Terms are deemed
          to have been incorporated into these Terms of Use as Incorporated Terms, and you hereby agree to grant such
          Third Party, such direct rights of enforcement against you.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the avoidance of doubt, without prejudice to Clause 4.4, to the extent of any inconsistency between these
          Terms of Use and the Third Party Terms, the latter shall prevail provided nothing in the Third Party Terms
          increases the liability of GovTech beyond that stated in Clause 6.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Your Consent to Access Functions of Your Device
      <ol>
        <li>
          Use of the Service may require you to allow access by the Service to certain functions of your device, such as
          push notifications, the obtaining and/or sharing of your location, or the collection of data from you in
          connection with the Service. Please also see clause 8 (Privacy Policy). Your use of the Service shall
          constitute your consent to the access by the Service of such functions of your device as may be reasonably
          required by the Service.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Disclaimers and Indemnity
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Service is provided on an "as is" and “as available” basis without warranties of any kind. To the fullest
          extent permitted by law, GovTech does not make any representations or warranties of any kind whatsoever in
          relation to the Service and hereby disclaims all express, implied and/or statutory warranties of any kind to
          you or any third party, whether arising from usage or custom or trade or by operation of law or otherwise,
          including but not limited to any representations or warranties:
          <ol>
            <li>
              as to the accuracy, completeness, correctness, currency, timeliness, reliability, availability,
              interoperability, security, non-infringement, title, merchantability, quality or fitness for any
              particular purpose of the Service; and/or
            </li>
            <li>
              that the Service or any functions associated therewith will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that
              defects will be corrected or that this Service, website and the server are and will be free of all viruses
              and/or other malicious, destructive or corrupting code, programme or macro.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          GovTech shall also not be liable to you or any third party for any damage or loss of any kind whatsoever and
          howsoever caused, including but not limited to any direct or indirect, special or consequential damages, loss
          of income, revenue or profits, lost or damaged data, or damage to your computer, software or any other
          property, whether arising directly or indirectly from –
          <ol>
            <li>your access to or use of this Service, or any part thereof;</li>
            <li>any loss of access to our use of this Service or any part of this Service, howsoever caused;</li>
            <li>any inaccuracy or incompleteness in, or errors or omissions in the transmission of, the Service;</li>
            <li>
              any delay or interruption in the transmission of the Service, whether caused by delay or interruption in
              transmission over the internet or otherwise; or
            </li>
            <li>
              any decision made or action taken by you or any third party in reliance upon the Service, regardless of
              whether GovTech has been advised of the possibility of such damage or loss.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Without prejudice and in addition to the foregoing, insofar as the Service facilitates or requires the
          provision, use or functioning of, or is provided in conjunction with, other products, software, materials
          and/or services not provided by GovTech, GovTech makes no representation or warranty in relation to such
          products, software, materials and/or services (including without limitation any representation or warranties
          as to timeliness, reliability, availability, interoperability, quality, fitness for purpose, non-infringement,
          suitability or accuracy).
        </li>
        <li>
          You shall not rely on any part of the Service to claim or assert any form of legitimate expectation against
          GovTech, whether or not arising out of or in connection with GovTech’s roles and functions as a public
          authority.
        </li>
        <li>
          You agree to defend and indemnify and keep GovTech and its officers, employees, agents and contractors
          harmless against all liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses (including legal costs on an indemnity
          basis) howsoever arising out of or in connection with your access or use of the Service (including third party
          software or services) or your non-compliance with the Terms of Use, Third Party Terms or Incorporated Terms,
          whether or not you had been advised or informed of the nature or extent of such liabilities, losses, damages,
          costs or expenses.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Hyperlinks
      <ol>
        <li>
          Insofar as the Service provides a hyperlink to material not maintained or controlled by GovTech, GovTech shall
          not be responsible for the content of the hyperlinked material and shall not be liable for any damages or loss
          arising from access to the hyperlinked material. Use of the hyperlinks and access to such hyperlinked
          materials are entirely at your own risk. The hyperlinks are provided merely as a convenience to you and do not
          imply endorsement by, association or affiliation with GovTech of the contents of or provider of the
          hyperlinked materials.
        </li>
        <li>
          Caching and hyperlinking to, and the framing of, any part of the Service is prohibited save where you have
          obtained GovTech’s prior written consent. Such consent may be subject to any conditions as may be determined
          by GovTech in its sole discretion. If you hyperlink to or frame any part of the Service, that shall constitute
          your acceptance of these Terms of Use and all amendments thereto. If you do not accept these Terms of Use as
          may be amended from time to time, you must immediately discontinue linking to or framing of any part of the
          Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          GovTech reserves all rights:
          <ol>
            <li>
              to disable any links to, or frames of, any materials which are unauthorised (including without limitation
              materials which imply endorsement by or association or affiliation with GovTech, materials containing
              inappropriate, profane, defamatory, infringing, obscene, indecent or unlawful topics, names, or
              information that violates any written law, any applicable intellectual property, proprietary, privacy or
              publicity rights); and
            </li>
            <li>
              to disclaim responsibility and/or liability for materials that link to or frame any part of the Service
            </li>

          Privacy Policy will form part of these Terms of Use.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Rights of Third Parties
      <ol>
        <li>
          Subject to the rights of the Third Party set out in Clause 4.5, a person who is not a party to this Terms of
          Use shall have no right under the Contract (Rights of Third Parties) Act or otherwise to enforce any of its
          terms.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Assignment
      <ol>
        <li>You may not assign or sub-contract this Terms of Use without the prior written consent of GovTech.</li>
        <li>
          GovTech may assign, novate, transfer, or sub-contract the rights and liabilities in respect of the Service and
          this Terms of Use, without notifying you and without further reference to you. Your acceptance of this Terms
          of Use shall also constitute your consent to such assignment, novation, transfer or sub-contract
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
      <ol>
        <li>These Terms of Use shall be governed and construed in accordance with laws of Singapore.</li>
        <li>
          Subject to clause 11.3, any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Use, including any
          question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved in the
          Courts of the Republic of Singapore and the parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts
          of the Republic of Singapore.
        </li>
        <li>
          GovTech may, at its sole discretion, refer any dispute referred to in clause 11.2 above to arbitration
          administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre ("<b>SIAC</b>") in Singapore in accordance with
          the Arbitration Rules of the SIAC ("SIAC Rules") for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be
          incorporated by reference in this clause. Further:
          <ol>
            <li>The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore.</li>
            <li>The tribunal shall consist of one (1) arbitrator.</li>
            <li>The language of the arbitration shall be English.</li>
            <li>

            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Where GovTech is the defendant or respondent, it shall be given at least 30 days before the commencement of
          any legal action against it to elect to exercise the right herein to have the dispute submitted to
          arbitration. This right to elect shall not prejudice GovTech’s right to a limitation defence and the period to
          exercise the right shall not be abridged by reason of any accrual of a limitation defence in favour of GovTech
          during the said period.
        </li>
